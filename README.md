pebbLIFX
=========

pebbLIFX is a Pebble application that allows you to control your LIFX bulbs when your phone is in range of your WiFi network. 

pebbLIFX uses two critical libraries to gain this functionality:

* lifxjs for communication to the LIFX bulbs.
* Anode for the node server sending commands in the companion Android app.
